# Get Your Glucose Tracked - Swift Student Challenge 2025 Project

## Overview
Get Your Glucose Tracked is a one-person-developed solution aimed at simplifying the process of tracking fasting and postprandial (2-hour) blood glucose levels for diabetes patients. Recording these values manually is often cumbersome, so this app streamlines the process to make diabetes management more efficient and user-friendly.

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by the need to reduce the burden of manual blood glucose tracking for diabetes patients. Leveraging prototyping skills learned during the Apple Developer Academy @POSTECH Foundation Program, I explored Swift programming and SwiftUI to bring this idea to life.

## Key Features
- Simplifies blood glucose tracking by focusing on fasting and postprandial values.
- Provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface built with SwiftUI.
- Enhances user experience with clean design principles and optimized workflows.

## Development Process
This app was developed as part of the Swift Student Challenge 2025. It represents a significant milestone in my journey as a developer, as I independently:
- Learned and applied Swift programming language.
- Designed and implemented the UI using SwiftUI.
- Prototyped the app based on foundational skills acquired from Apple Developer Academy.

## Why Get Your Glucose Tracked?
Managing diabetes effectively requires consistent monitoring of blood glucose levels, but manual tracking can be time-consuming and prone to errors. GlucoTrack addresses this pain point by offering a streamlined solution that saves time and effort while maintaining accuracy.

## How to Use
1. Open the app and input your fasting or postprandial blood glucose levels.
2. View automatically generated trends and insights over time.
3. Use the app regularly to monitor your progress and maintain better control of your condition.
